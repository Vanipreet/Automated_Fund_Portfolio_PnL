# Automated_Fund_Portfolio_PnL
The purpose of [Portfolio_P&L.xlsm](https://github.com/Vanipreet/Automated_Fund_Portfolio_PnL/blob/master/Portfolio_P%26L.xlsm) is to create an automated process for the execution of Portfolio's / Fund's profit and loss analysis. There are multiple assumptions and pre-requisites that has been kept in place for the smooth execution of this macro.

# Assumptions
This macro is built with few assumptions in mind as listed below

1. For the macro to run, we need two external data inputs, pricing data and transactions data
2. The macro is prepared for the purpose of daily portfolio valuation and hence uses daily pricing data
3. Initial investment is assumed to be USD 800,000 
4. Macro and the data inputs are available under H:\Portfolio P&L directory, however as per the drive parition, this can be amended
5. Macro expects static input data. However with appropriate mapping, database can be also accurated utilized
